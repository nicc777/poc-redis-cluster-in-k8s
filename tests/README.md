# POC Testing

After the Redis cluster and client have been deployed, the [Python Locust](https://locust.io/) script(s) can be used to test the Redis cluster via the deployed [Redis Client](../test-service/README.md).

> **Note**
> For local testing, use `kubectl` to create a Port forwarder to the client service.
